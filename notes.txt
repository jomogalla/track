-- Thoughts
> create a uniform naming across the board for cleaning data before the server request
----> right now we have formatted, new, cleaned, etc
> change time entry data that gets pushed to include seconds?
> round time data on view page to nearest 15 minutes?


-- To Do
X connect httpservice
X rebuild addtask, addproject, archive, starttime, stoptime, getprojects, gettasks, gettimeentries to use httpservice
X add delete task functionality
X add rename task functionality
X add billable boolean task functionality
X add requirecomment boolean task functionality
> configure routing
> set up angular to use templates
> refactor angular-stuff.js into separate controller files
> make start/stop time display to be more robust.
> make comments on view page editable
> make time on view page editable
> allow deleting of entries on view page
> organize view so it separates time entries between dates
> remove tracking and editing from tables? 
> ngblur on a task name change wont send data to the server




>>> BUGs <<<<
> When RequireComment and Billable are both switched to true, one of them sets itself to false
> Cant add task after a project is freshly created
