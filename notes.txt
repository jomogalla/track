BOOOT BOY 

-- Thoughts
> create a uniform naming across the board for cleaning data before the server request
----> right now we have formatted, new, cleaned, etc
> change time entry data that gets pushed to include seconds?
> round time data on view page to nearest 15 minutes?


-- To Do
X connect httpservice
X rebuild addtask, addproject, archive, starttime, stoptime, getprojects, gettasks, gettimeentries to use httpservice
X add delete task functionality
X add rename task functionality
X add billable boolean task functionality
X add requirecomment boolean task functionality
X configure routing
X FIX GULP FILE SO IT ACTUALLY PUTS FILES INTO THE BUILD FOLDER
X Have tracking page load any unstopped timeentries as running
X set up angular to use templates
X change controllers to Papa Style
X add navbar to its on file & controller
X add active navigation items
X make start/stop time display to be more robust.
X refactor angular-stuff.js into separate controller files
X get timeentries to add to the time entry list when stopped(probably with a get request, not from the system)
X organize view so it separates time entries between dates
X if you start one task, it ends any currently running tasks
X logout
X route changes based on logged in status 
X Use LESS
X Responsive nav bar
X Use npm init in folder to create package.json
X Do the get requests for controllers in the routing
X Move server formatting into a service?
X reorganize stoptracking/clock, starttracking/clock, and restart
X Do the route get requests resolve in the controller and not in the router?

> Gulp inject scripts
> Gulp minify/concatenate


> update comments to save on change


-- Big Items --
> Bower Package Management
> Gulp Unit Testing


> make comments on view page editable
> make time on view page editable
> allow deleting of entries on view page

> remove tracking and editing from tables? 


>> Routing <<
/ - if logged in > track
	else > login


>>> BUGs <<<<
X When RequireComment and Billable are both switched to true, one of them sets itself to false
	^ WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE, THE REQUESTS ARE ALL GOOD
X Timer in tracking adds 4 hours to the timer

> Cant add task after a project is freshly created
	probably need to do a get request then add the project to the list of projects
> start, stop, then start a time entry, causes bad put data
> ngblur on a task name change wont send data to the server
