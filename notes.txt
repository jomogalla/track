BOOOT BOY 

-- Thoughts
> create a uniform naming across the board for cleaning data before the server request
----> right now we have formatted, new, cleaned, etc
> change time entry data that gets pushed to include seconds?
> round time data on view page to nearest 15 minutes?


-- To Do
X connect httpservice
X rebuild addtask, addproject, archive, starttime, stoptime, getprojects, gettasks, gettimeentries to use httpservice
X add delete task functionality
X add rename task functionality
X add billable boolean task functionality
X add requirecomment boolean task functionality
X configure routing
X FIX GULP FILE SO IT ACTUALLY PUTS FILES INTO THE BUILD FOLDER
X Have tracking page load any unstopped timeentries as running
> Use LESS
> change controllers to Papa Style
	- Declare functions up top vm.functionName = functionName, then put the function below
	- Remove ng-controller="Controller as vm" from templates, pass in ngroute
> add active navigation items
> update comments to save on change
> if you start one task, it ends any currently running tasks
> get timeentries to add to the time entry list when stopped(probably with a get request, not from the system)
X set up angular to use templates
> refactor angular-stuff.js into separate controller files
X make start/stop time display to be more robust.
> make comments on view page editable
> make time on view page editable
> allow deleting of entries on view page
> organize view so it separates time entries between dates
> remove tracking and editing from tables? 
> ngblur on a task name change wont send data to the server




>>> BUGs <<<<
> When RequireComment and Billable are both switched to true, one of them sets itself to false
> Cant add task after a project is freshly created
	probably need to do a get request then add the project to the list of projects
